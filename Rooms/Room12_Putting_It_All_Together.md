**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Path:** Pre Security  

## What I did
- Reviewed everything I learned in module 2 of the pre security path for tryhackme.

## Key concepts
- Load balancers help ensure high traffic website can handle the load and giving a failover if a serer fails. Just uses servers to help your request ifit fails. Health check to make sure the user is still there.
- CDN content delivrey networks are excelltnet resources for cutting down traffic in a busy website. You can jost you website across a bunch of servers and wherever the closes server is to the user it goes there
- Databases are way of storting inforation for the user and webservers use this to help store alot of information
- WAF or web applcation firewall is to protect the webserver for a hacking or dOS attack.

## One takeaway
- Websites have multiple functions that make them possible to work and the process is not easy and is alot.
