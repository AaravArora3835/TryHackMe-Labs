**Path:** Pre Security  

## What I did
- Learn how websites actually function including most of their properties in detail.

## Key concepts
- Front end or Clientsode os tje way our browser views the website and backend or the server side is the way a server procceses our request and gives us a response.
- Websites use HTML CSS and JAVA
- HTML: used for building websites and giving the strucutre. Stand for hyper text markup language. Uses different strcutures and syntaxes to work.
- Java script or JS is the most ppopular coding langauge in the world and alows for websites to be interactive. Used to make websites function and websites would notbe interactive without it, snf updates pages in real time.
- Sensivite data expossure happens when a website does not peroperly protect information,, developed somehow forget to remove these credentials and attackers can hack it easily.
- HTML injection is when a vulnerability that happens when user input is displayed and the website does not filter any malicious text an atacker injetcs bad html code.
- Devleopers neet to sanitize everything theuser enters before it is in a javscrpt function.

## One takeaway
- HTML Injections are very dangerous and developers need to make sure that they ar able to sanitize information.
