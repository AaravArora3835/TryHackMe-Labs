# Room 08 — Extending Your Network

**Date:** 2025-02-04
**Path:** Pre Security  

## What I did
- I learned about vpns, firewalls, swithces, and routers

## Key concepts
- WIthout portforwading applications and services like websites wouldonly be availible to devices in the same network.
- Portforwading opens specific ports which helps make stuff availible to the publc.
- Routers are used to confirgure port forwarding
- Firewals are devices in a network that help choose what traffic enters and leaves. It is like a border securtiy for a network. Adminstartor in a system can choose a firewall to allow or deny traffic leaving or entering.
- Factors like where is it coming from, where is it going to, which port is it for, and what protocol.
- Firewalls happen in the 4th and 5th layer of OSI.
- Stateful inspects entire connection while stateless inspects indivual packets.
- Virtual Private Network or VPN helps allow devices on different networks to communicate by making a path to ach other over the iternet. They form their own private network in here.
- VPNs offer privacy andanomitaltiy and also networks in diferent regions to be connected
- A routers job is to connect networks and pass data between them which it does by rotuing the data.
- A switch is a networking device which is used for connecting multiple devices. 
- 

## One takeaway
- Very important for orginzations to use all of these methods to keep their secuirty posture good.
