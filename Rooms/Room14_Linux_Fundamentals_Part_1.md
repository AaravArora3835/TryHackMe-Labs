## Key concepts
- Linux was released in 1991
- Terminal is where you run commandsan dis only tect based. ECHO is used to output any text we provide and whoami shows the user we are currently logged in as.
- ls is listing, cd is change dreictery, ca is oncatenate, and pwd is print working directory,
- ls is used for finding what is in folders
- cd is used for changing the directory or files you are in
- cat is used for outputing the content for files and not just text files and shows whats in there.
- pwd prits the directory you are currently in so it helps tell you where you are.
- find is used for automating finding specific files or documents
- grep is used for searching the contens of a file you are looking for.
- & is used to run commands in the background, && is used to combine multiple commands in one line, > is used as a redirector, and >> does the same thingbut appends it.
