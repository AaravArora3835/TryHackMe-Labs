# Room 07 — Packets & Frames

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Path:** Pre Security  

## What I did
- Understand how data is divided into smaller pieces and transmitted across a network to another device

## Key concepts
- Pakcets and frames are small pieces of data. When combined they make larger pieces of informatiom.
- Packets are efficient because they are small so there is less chance of bottlenecking.
- TCP or Transmission COntrol Protocol
- Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface.
- TCP is connection based and is must have a connection before data is sent.
- Guarantees data will be received in the other end.
- Advantages of TCP: Guarantees intergiry, makes devices know to have the data in the right order, and is reliable. However, it needs internet and if one small chunk it not received then the entire chunk cannot be used and a slow connection will break it.
- 3 way handshake goes like, here is my syn trying to connect to you, heres my syn so we can connect and i acknowledge this, okay i acknoldeged too heres the data i senat.
- UDP or user datagram protocol does not need a constant connection which means it is stateless, udp is faster does reserve a connection. Doesnt care if data is receivedor not and unstanve connections is very bad.
- Ports is a point where data can get exchanged. 

## One takeaway
- Learned more about UDP and TCP, 3 way handshake and ports as well.
